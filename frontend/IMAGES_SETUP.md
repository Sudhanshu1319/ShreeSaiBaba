## How to Add Images

1. Get the images from the temple or official sources
2. Optimize them for web (compress to reasonable file sizes)
3. Place them in `frontend/public/images/` folder
4. Name them exactly as listed above
5. The website will automatically display them

## Image Format Recommendations

- **Format**: JPG or WebP (JPG is more compatible)
- **Max file size**: 500KB per image (for faster loading)
- **Quality**: High quality but optimized for web

## Current Status

The website is set up to display images. Currently, placeholder areas are shown where images should appear. Once you add the images to the `/public/images/` folder with the correct names, they will automatically appear on the website.

## Priority Images

**Most Important to Add First:**
1. `baba-murti.jpg` - This is the main image that appears on the home page
2. `baba-shirdi-picture.jpg` - Picture on the wall behind Baba's murti
3. `temple-exterior.jpg` - For photo gallery
4. `temple-interior.jpg` - For photo gallery

These are the most visible images that visitors will see first.
